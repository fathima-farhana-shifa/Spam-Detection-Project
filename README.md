SMS Spam Detection Project
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as "spam" or "ham" (legitimate). The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as either "spam" or "ham" and is used to train and evaluate machine learning models for spam detection.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as either spam or ham (legitimate). It consists of the following columns:

v1: Label indicating the message type ("spam" or "ham").
v2: The raw text of the SMS message.
Class Distribution
Ham (legitimate): 87%
Spam: 13%
Project Goals
The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a machine learning model capable of classifying SMS messages into two categories: spam and ham. This will help build an automated system to filter out spam messages from legitimate ones.

Tasks Performed
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Investigated the dataset to understand its structure and distribution.
Analyzed the distribution of spam and ham messages.
Visualized patterns using various techniques, such as word clouds for spam and ham messages.
2. Text Preprocessing
Cleaned the raw text data by:
Converting all text to lowercase.
Removing punctuation and special characters.
Removing stopwords to enhance model performance.
Converted the text into numerical format using vectorization techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
3. Model Development
Built multiple classification models, including:
Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Optionally, experimented with deep learning models like LSTMs or Transformers for better accuracy.
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluated the models using various performance metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Compared the results of different models and preprocessing techniques.
Model Development
We built a machine learning model for SMS spam classification using several algorithms. These include:

Naive Bayes: Suitable for text classification tasks, particularly in cases like spam detection.
Logistic Regression: A linear classifier used to predict the probability of an SMS message being spam or ham.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A classification model that works well for high-dimensional data, such as text.
Optionally, deep learning models like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and Transformer-based models could be experimented with for further optimization and higher accuracy.

Model Evaluation
To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance, we used the following metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
Precision: Indicates how many of the messages predicted as spam were actually spam.
Recall: Measures how many of the actual spam messages were correctly identified.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.
Insights and Visualizations
During the analysis, several insights were uncovered:

Common Spam Keywords: Certain words, such as "free," "win," and "cash," appeared frequently in spam messages.
Word Cloud Visualization: Word clouds were used to visualize patterns in both spam and ham messages to understand common words associated with each category.
Class Distribution: The dataset is imbalanced, with ham messages significantly outnumbering spam messages.
